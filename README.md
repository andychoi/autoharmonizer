# AutoHarmonizer

## Melody Harmonization with Controllable Harmonic Rhythm

This is the source code of AutoHarmonizer, a harmonic rhythm-controllable melody harmonization system. \
\
The input melodies and harmonized samples are in the 'inputs' and 'outputs' folders respectively.\
\
Musical discrimination test is available at https://sander-wood.github.io/autoharmonizer. \
\
Nottingham Lead Sheet Dataset (NLSD) and Session Lead Sheet Dataset (SLSD) are both in the 'dataset' folder.\
\
For more information, see our paper: arXiv paper.\

## Install Dependencies
Python: 3.7.9\
Keras: 2.3.0\
tensorflow-gpu: 2.2.0\
music21: 6.7.1\
\
PS: Third party libraries can be installed using the 'pip install' command.\

## Generate Samples
1. Put the melodies (MIDI or MusicXML) in the 'inputs' folder;\
2. Simply run 'harmonizer.py';\
3. Wait a while and the harmonized melodies will be saved in the 'outputs' folder.\
\
PS: You can set the parameter RHYTHM_DENSITY ∈ (0, 1) in 'config.py' to adjust the density of the generated chord progression. The lower the value of RHYTHM_DENSITY, the fewer chords will be generated, and vice versa.\

## Use Your Own Dataset
1.　Store all lead sheets (MIDI or MusicXML) in the 'dataset' folder, if you only have a small amount of data yourself, you can keep the original dataset of this system;\
2.　Run 'loader.py', which will generate 'rhythm_corpus.bin' and 'chord_corpus.bin'; \
3.　Run 'train.py', which will generate 'rhythm_weights.hdf5' and 'chord_weights.hdf5'.\
\
After that, you can use 'harmonizer.py' to harmonize music that with chord progressions that fit the musical style of the new dataset. \
\
If you need to finetune the parameters, you can do so in 'config.py'. It is not recommended to change the parameters in other files.
